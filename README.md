# toysql

I work with sql databases everyday but I don't have deep understanding of how they work.

This is a dependency free minimalistic clone of sqllite written in python. You should be able to follow the code and improve your understanding of databases.

## Questions:

* What format is data stored on disk?
* Joins implementation?
* Indexes implementation?
