I work with sql databases everyday but I don't have deep understanding of how they work.

This is a dependency free, minimal clone of sql written in python. You should be able to follow the code and improve your understanding of databases.

## Questions:

* What format is data stored on disk?
* Joins implementation?
* Indexes implementation?

Next steps:

1. One by one implement bytes backend for Tree.
2. Store tree to disk with Pager.
