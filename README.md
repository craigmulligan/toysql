# toysql [WIP]


This is a dependency free sql database written in python. I've intentionally tried to keep the feature set & accompanying code "simple", ignoring edge cases and optimizations so that anyone can read through and improve their understanding of how databases work.

## Why 

I work with sql databases everyday but don't have deep understanding of how they work, this is an attempt to improve my understanding of their implementation. Implementing one covers a wide variety of topics like lexing, parsing, VMs, tree algorithms, serialization formats.

## Current Features

Check the (end-to-end tests)[tests/test_e2e.py] for an idea of current features. Anything beyond that is likely to break.
